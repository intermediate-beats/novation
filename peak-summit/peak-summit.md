## Efficiently Name Patches

Naming patches sucks.

Press `SAVE` and you're greeted with a prompt to enter a name, but the prompt is filled with `INITIALIZE`. To change the word, you must use the top and middle "screen keys" to move between columns, and the "screen potentiometer" to change the letter/character. These HID controls are fine, but it is confusing to keep track of which letter in the word `INITIALIZE` you're on versus which direction you need to go:

```
??????????
GLGRG?JGXC
HMHSH?KHYD
INITIALIZE
JOJUJBMJ?F
KPKVKCNK?G
??????????
```

Quick! Which direction do you need to scroll on column four to reach the character `U`?

Too late. I was already scrolling *down* -

The solution is to erase the entire word before entering yours.

1. Press `SAVE`.
2. Mash the bottom "screen key" until `INITIALIZE` is erased. Each time you press this key the current character is erased and the cursor is advanced.
3. Mash the top "screen key" until the cursor is back at the starting positions.
4. Steps one, two, and three can be complete in about  seconds with practice.
5. You are now ready to enter your new patch name. Every letter will start at `A` which makes writing a word trivial.
